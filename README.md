# Enigma Machine

This repo follows my exploration of both the Enigma Machine and the .Net Architecture.

### Test Driven Development
The EnigmaMachine logic was implemented in C# with a Test Driven Development mindset.
The logic code is fully functional and has 100% test coverage.

### Terminal usage
To encrypt/decrypt a message in the terminal follow the code present in Enigma/Program.cs.

### WebApp
I am currently exploring the Blazor WASM framework and intend to create a fully interactable
Enigma Machine.
